#### Create your own Image Classifier

##### Overview
Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

The whole workflow is contained in <a href = './index.html'> this Jupyter Notebook.</a>

##### Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory / (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:
